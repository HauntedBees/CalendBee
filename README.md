# CalendBee

Keep track of when you do recurring tasks, so you can see how much time passes between them, such as how long it takes to use up a bar of soap or bottle of shampoo or something. This thing doesn't really do much else.

## Build

1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. `npm run build`
    a. Or `npm run dev` for hot reload.
3. You'll probably want to update the icon paths in `manifest.webmanifest`, too.
